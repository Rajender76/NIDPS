Developed a real-time network security system in Python using Scapy for packet analysis and iptables for threat mitigation. Implemented detection algorithms for port scanning, DDoS attacks, and OS fingerprinting using time-windowing techniques and multi-threaded packet sniffing across network interfaces.
